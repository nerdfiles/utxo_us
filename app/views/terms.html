      <p>USER AGREEMENT</p>

      <p><b>3.1.

      <p><b>3.2. Identity Verification.</b>&nbsp;In order to use certain features of the UTXO Services, including certain transfers of bitcoin and/or currency, you may be required to provide UTXO with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number).

You further authorize any and all third parties to which inquiries such as the above may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests. </b>UTXO will not distribute your information to third parties that are not involved in the verification process.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>4. Bitcoin Transaction</p>

      <p><b>4.1. Sending Mined Bitcoin.</b></p>

      <p><b>4.1.1. </b>UTXO reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Bitcoin Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. UTXO cannot reverse a Bitcoin Transaction which has been communicated to and confirmed by the Bitcoin network.</p>

      <p><b>4.1.2.</b>&nbsp;UTXO processes Bitcoin Transactions according to the instructions received from the user in each transaction and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to UTXO as the relevant Bitcoin Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.</p>

      <p><b>4.1.3.</b>&nbsp;If you initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient&#39;s bitcoin address, UTXO will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, UTXO cannot confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. It is entirely your responsibility to confirm and accurately provide the address you wish bitcoins to be sent to.</p>

      <p><b>4.2 Bitcoin Storage &amp; Transmission Delays.</b>&nbsp;UTXO securely stores 100% of all its mined bitcoin private keys in our control. This may delay the initiation or crediting of such Bitcoin Transaction for 24 hours or more. As a user of the UTXO Services, you accept the risk that a Bitcoin Transaction facilitated by UTXO may be delayed and you agree not to hold UTXO responsible for any damages or injury arising out of or related to such delay.</p>

      <p><b>4.3. Your Bitcoin Transaction Taxes.</b>&nbsp;It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt of mined coin using the UTXO Services. It is also your sole responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.</p>

      <p><b>4.4 Advanced Protocols</b>. We do not currently provide metacoins, colored coins, or any advanced protocol which supplements the core Bitcoin Protocol. Do not use your UTXO Account to receive mined coin involving an advanced protocol. UTXO is not responsible for any loss which may result from such use.</p>

      <p>5. Mined Coin Service.</p>

      <p><b>5.1. Transactions with UTXO.</b>&nbsp;When buying mined bitcoin through the Mined Coin Service, you are buying from UTXO directly. UTXO does not act in any way as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin. Any transactions you subsequently engage in involving the trade or sale of coin are solely your responsibility. This includes all KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. UTXO shall have no liability or interest regarding your future sales of the bitcoin. The Mined Coin Service is subject to the UTXO &quot;Conversion Rate.&quot; &quot;Conversion Rate&quot; means the liquidity-adjusted price of a given bitcoin amount in terms of local currency as quoted on the UTXO Site. The Conversion Rate is stated as a &quot;Buy Price,&quot; the price in terms of United States Dollars at which you purchase mined bitcoin from UTXO. For the purpose of any transaction with UTXO for mined coins you agree, as a condition of using any UTXO Services, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric.</p>

      <p><b>5.2. Bitcoin Purchases.</b>&nbsp;After successfully completing the applicable verification steps described in the Verification Procedures below, you may purchase mined bitcoin from UTXO, subject to applicable limits. UTXO will instruct its financial institution to initiate a debit to your primary payment method in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of mined bitcoin you wish to purchase multiplied by the Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the UTXO Site at the time that you initiate the transaction, plus (b) additional fees as may apply in the event that UTXO cannot draw funds from your payment method and must charge a backup payment method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, UTXO will provide a date by which your bitcoin will be made available, which may depend on the time required for UTXO to receive funds from your payment method. Although UTXO will attempt to deliver bitcoin to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your primary payment method before bitcoin are delivered to your UTXO account. If your bitcoin purchase is marked as complete or pending you cannot cancel, reverse, or change the order, although UTXO reserves the right to cancel the order as stated within this Agreement. In connection with any purchase of bitcoin from UTXO, UTXO will use good faith efforts to fulfill such purchase order at the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the UTXO Site at the time that you place such order. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for UTXO to delay fulfillment of a purchase order until such time as we are able to execute the transaction. In such cases, we will notify you prior to the completion of your purchase order that the amount of bitcoin that you will receive will be determined based on the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the UTXO.</p>

      <p><b>5.3. Limits.</b>&nbsp;UTXO imposes limits on the amount mined bitcoin that you may buy in a given day. UTXO reserves the right to change the limits imposed as we deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. UTXO does not guarantee the availability of its Mined Coin Service. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may submit a request to support@UTXO.us. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with UTXO staff (hereinafter be &quot;Enhanced Due Diligence&quot;). UTXO reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.</p>

      <p><b>5.4. Payments.</b></p>

      <p><b>5.4.1.</b>&nbsp;You agree to deliver payment for any bitcoin purchase made through the Mined Coin Service upon confirmation of an order, regardless of changes in the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate prior to completion of the purchase transaction, with such payment to be made in good funds in the amount calculated in the manner specified herein.</p>

      <p><b>5.4.2.</b>&nbsp;If your primary payment method does not have sufficient funds to cover the purchase price of any bitcoin order or any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder, UTXO may immediately reverse the transaction. UTXO is under no obligation to attempt to fulfill your purchase using an alternative payment method should your primary payment method fail. You hereby authorize us to debit any of your payment methods which have been linked to your UTXO Account for the full or partial amount of your purchase and any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder. We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in each of your accounts and sufficient credit limits on your credit cards in order to avoid any overdraft, NSF or similar fees. To secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement, you grant to UTXO a security interest in any and all of your funds or other property which come into the possession of UTXO and the bitcoin associated with your UTXO Account. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.</p>

      <p><b>5.4.3.</b>&nbsp;UTXO reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases of mined bitcoin at its sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), including but not limited to instances where UTXO suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if UTXO suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, UTXO will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</p>

      <p><b>5.4.4.</b>&nbsp;If your transaction is initiated outside of bank business hours, the credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the bitcoin Conversion Rate at the time of the transaction will apply. If your Bank is unable to process any electronic debit entry, UTXO will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may use any of the remedies set forth in this User Agreement to recover any amount owed to UTXO.</p>

      <p>6. Customer Feedback, Queries, and Complaints</p>

      <p><b>6.1. We take customer feedback very seriously. </b>UTXO will try to help you with any problems you may have regarding the UTXO website and service. UTXO wants the user experience on our website to be top-notch. However, UTXO helping you should not be seen as UTXO having or accepting a duty beyond those required by law. <b>&nbsp;</b></p>

      <p><b>6.2. Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action.</b>&nbsp;If you have a dispute with UTXO, we will attempt to resolve any such disputes through our support team.&nbsp;<b>If we cannot resolve the dispute through our support team, you and we agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in arbitration, on an individual basis in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&#39;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and UTXO hereby expressly waive trial by jury</b>. The arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The arbitration panel shall consist of a single arbitrator using the substantive law of Texas in the United States excluding any Choice of Law provisions in Texas. The arbitration shall not take, in total, more than four hearings and sixty calendar days. At either party&rsquo;s request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone or other electronic means, including videoconference, and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&#39; fees. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

      <p><b>6.3. Time Limitation on Claims.</b>&nbsp;You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with UTXO must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>

      <p>7. General Provisions.</p>

      <p><b>7.1. Limitations of Liability.</b>&nbsp;IN NO EVENT SHALL UTXO, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE UTXO SITE, THE UTXO SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE). Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. THE LIABILITY OF UTXO, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF (A) THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES; OR (B) VALUE OF MINED BITCOIN PROVIDED TO YOU BYIN THE PRECEDING THREE (3) MONTHS.</p>

      <p><b>7.2. Sanctions Compliance.</b>&nbsp;Pursuant to the economic sanctions programs administered in the countries where UTXO conducts business, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Treasury&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;), UTXO is prohibited from providing services or entering into relationships with certain individuals and entities. In the event that UTXO is required to block assets associated with your UTXO Account in accordance with a sanctions program, or other similar government sanctions programs, UTXO may cancel your transactions or block user activity. UTXO is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our complying with applicable law, the guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, or any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant or other legal order.</p>

      <p><b>7.3. Computer and Mobile Viruses.</b>&nbsp;We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from UTXO. Always log into your UTXO Account through the UTXO Site directly to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.</p>

      <p><b>7.4. No Warranty.</b>&nbsp;THE UTXO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. UTXO SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. UTXO DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT ACCESS TO ANY PART OF THE UTXO SERVICES, OR ANY OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN, WILL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      <p><b>7.6.

      <p>APPENDIX II: VERIFICATION PROCEDURES AND LIMITS</p>

      <p>UTXO uses multi-level systems and procedures to collect and verify information about you in order to protect UTXO and the community from fraudulent users, and to keep appropriate records of UTXO&rsquo;s customers. Your daily or weekly limits on transactions from a linked payment method are based on the identifying information and/or proof of identity you provide to UTXO. UTXO is required by US law to engage in Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering practices. UTXO takes this obligation very seriously and believes it betters the security of Bitcoin sales. In order to meet these requirements, all users who wish to buy bitcoin using UTXO&rsquo;s Mined Coin Service, at minimum, must:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Establish a UTXO Account by providing your name and accepting the UTXO User Terms</li>
        <li>Add and verify a phone number</li>
        <li>Add and verify a bank account</li>
        <li>Add personal details (full name, date of birth, residential address)</li>
        <li>Complete identity verification by answering a few questions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These are only minimum verification procedures for the referenced UTXO Services. UTXO may require you to provide or verify additional information, or to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction, before permitting you to use any UTXO Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You may contact&nbsp;support@UTXO.us&nbsp;to request larger limits. UTXO will require you to submit to Enhanced Due Diligence. Additional fees and costs may apply, and UTXO does not guarantee that we will raise your limits.</p>
